# External code

This directory contains files needed for running scripts using the COCO protocol. The modules are copies from [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references/detection). The only module that I edited significantly is transform.py (renamed the old version to xforms.py). Aside from that, there are only small changes to accommodate the library locations for imports etc.
