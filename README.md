Extract information from images of herbarium specimens.

Given an image like:

![Herbarium Sample Image](assets/herbarium_sample_image.jpg)

We want to:
1. [Find all the labels on the image.](#Find-Labels)
1. [Crop and clean up the labels so that we can OCR them.](#Clean-Labels)
1. [OCR the cleaned up label images.](#OCR-Labels)
1. [Cleanup the OCR text.](#Clean-OCR-Text)
1. [Use NLP to extract information from the clean OCR text.](#Extract-Information)

We are going to treat this as a pipeline of Machine Learning (ML) models with swappable steps. This means that each step may be independently trained and implemented so that the appropriate model may be used for any particular dataset.

## Find Labels

## Clean Labels

## OCR Labels
