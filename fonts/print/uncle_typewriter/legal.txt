About the legal stuff,
you only need to know that you can use this free
font for whatever you want, commercial or not commercial. If you use this font there´s absolutly no problem,
but i would like to see a sample of the work, just for fun. It´s the only thing i ask for.

On the other side, you cannot 
 
redistribute,
sell, 
modify the font, 
put it on a cd with a commercial interest,
or put in on your web site for downloading 
without the permission of the autor.
